We got the virtual machines to communicate by adding two adapters, and setting the first one to NAT and the other one to internal. The internal network adapters need manual ip addresses and the other ones need DHCP to auto configure their ip address.

Used http://www.khromozome.com/how-to-hack-windows-10-using-kali-linux/ to setup an attack

- **TODAY**: Went over git, created new repo and added as collaborator
- **TODAY**: Go over chap 5 on linux booting
- **TODAY**: spend time creating a lab using virtualbox; got Kali and Win10


- **HW**: Configure kali box
- **HW**: Configure windows box
- **HW**: Make them pingable to each other
- **HW** Attempt this python project: http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/03_Strings/CaesarCypher/project04.pdf
